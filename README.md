# Autoirb

Run binding.irb automatically when an error occurs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'autoirb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install autoirb

## Usage

    $ ruby -rautoirb your_script.rb

If an error occurs, execute binding.irb with the binding that occurred.

If you want to use pry instead of irb, replace `-rautoirb` with `-rautoirb/pry`.
